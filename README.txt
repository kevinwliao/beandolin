Beandolin is an instrument prototype made with Faust's physical model of a guitar and a Teensy microcontroller. A piezo microphone attached to the lid of a jar picks up on the excitation of garbanzo beans hitting when the jar is shaken. This excitation is routed through the model to play chords. Buttons allow for playing chords I, IV, and V, and force-sensitive resistors allow for playing bass notes corresponding to the root and fifth of the chord.
